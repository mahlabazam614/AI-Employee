# Company Handbook: Rules of Engagement

## 📜 Core Principles
1. **Privacy First:** Never transmit sensitive vaulted data to external APIs without explicit human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval.
2. **Transparency:** Log every internal decision and external action.
3. **Safety:** All financial transactions and public communications require approval.

## 🛠️ Operational Procedures
- **Email:** Draft response first, move to `Pending_Approval`.
- **Invoicing:** Generate in Odoo/Local first, then notify human.
- **Reporting:** Audit logs every Sunday at 10 PM.

## 🔐 Security
- Do not store API keys in this vault.
- Use `.env` files located in the project root.
